## Conversion-First Philosophy

### The Hierarchy

```
1. CLARITY    → Can users understand what you offer in 5 seconds?
2. RELEVANCE  → Does it match what brought them here?
3. VALUE      → Is the benefit clear and compelling?
4. FRICTION   → What's stopping them from acting?
5. URGENCY    → Why should they act now?
```

### When Aesthetics vs Conversion Conflict

| Situation | Decision |
|-----------|----------|
| Beautiful animation delays CTA visibility | Reduce/remove animation |
| Minimal design hides trust signals | Add trust signals strategically |
| Creative layout confuses scanning | Use proven patterns |
| Bold design choice feels risky | A/B test it |
| "Cleaner" means fewer conversion elements | Test removal vs keeping |

**Default rule:** When in doubt, optimize for clarity over creativity.

|---------|-------------------|
| Bento grids | Scannable features → faster comprehension |
| Horizontal scroll | Immersive storytelling → emotional connection |
| Sticky sections | Persistent CTAs → higher click-through |

### elite-performance (Speed)

**Every second counts:**
- 1s delay = 7% conversion loss

- LCP > 2.5s = significant ranking penalty

Speed IS a conversion factor.

### elite-accessibility

## Quick Decision Framework

### Should I add this element?

```
1. Does it reduce friction? → Add it
2. Does it build trust? → Add it (strategically placed)
3. Does it distract from the CTA? → Remove or de-emphasize
4. Does it answer an objection? → Add it near the decision point
5. Does it look good but serve no purpose? → Remove it
```

### Should I test this change?

```
HIGH IMPACT (test first):
- Headlines and value props
- CTA copy and placement
- Pricing presentation
- Form fields (removing any)
- Social proof placement

LOW IMPACT (implement without test):
- Minor copy tweaks
- Color variations (usually)
- Icon changes
- Spacing adjustments
```

## Common Conversion Killers

### Above the Fold

- [ ] Unclear value proposition
- [ ] No visible CTA
- [ ] Slow loading hero image/video
- [ ] Generic stock photography
- [ ] Jargon-heavy headline

### Throughout the Page

- [ ] Missing social proof
- [ ] No trust signals (especially near payment)
- [ ] Too many choices (paradox of choice)
- [ ] Friction in forms (unnecessary fields)
- [ ] No urgency or reason to act now
- [ ] Mobile experience significantly worse

### Psychological

- [ ] Not addressing objections
- [ ] Benefits buried under features
- [ ] No risk reversal (guarantees, free trials)
- [ ] Asking for too much too soon
- [ ] Ignoring user's awareness level

3. **Social proof placement** - Near decision points, not just at bottom
4. **Mobile experience** - Where most traffic comes from
5. **Page speed** - Sub-3-second loads
6. **Trust signals** - Especially near payment/signup
