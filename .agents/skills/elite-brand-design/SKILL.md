## Brand vs Design

**Brand** is what people feel when they encounter you. It exists in their minds, not in your files.

**Branding** is the deliberate act of shaping that perception through consistent signals.

**Brand identity** is the system of visual, verbal, and experiential elements that carry those signals.

This skill covers creating brand identity from scratch — the strategic decisions that inform every design choice downstream.

## Brand Creation Process

### Phase 1: Discovery
Who are you? Who are you for? What do you believe?
→ See [brand-fundamentals.md](references/brand-fundamentals.md)

### Phase 2: Personality
What archetype fits? What traits define your voice?
→ See [brand-fundamentals.md](references/brand-fundamentals.md)

### Phase 3: Visual Identity
Logo, color, typography, texture — the visible system.
→ See [visual-identity-system.md](references/visual-identity-system.md), [brand-color-psychology.md](references/brand-color-psychology.md), [brand-typography.md](references/brand-typography.md)

### Phase 4: Verbal Identity
Tone of voice, messaging hierarchy, microcopy.
→ See [brand-tone-voice.md](references/brand-tone-voice.md)

### Phase 5: Documentation
Living style guide that scales with the team.
→ See [brand-style-guide.md](references/brand-style-guide.md)

## Brand Archetype Framework

Five production archetypes showing how brand personality maps to design:

| Archetype | Personality | Type Signal | Color Signal | Shape Signal |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| **Modern/Bold** | Confident, direct, technical | Geometric sans (Space Grotesk) | High-contrast dark + saturated accent | Moderate radius |
| **Luxury/Editorial** | Refined, aspirational, sensory | High-contrast serif (Cormorant Garamond) | Warm metallics on neutral | Soft radius |
| **Warm/Inclusive** | Safe, empathetic, human | Soft variable serif (Fraunces) | Muted expanded palette (plum/sage/lavender) | Generous radius |
| **Authoritative** | Commanding, trustworthy, established | Sturdy serif (Gelasio) | Traditional power colors (navy/gold) | Zero radius (sharp) |
| **Professional** | Competent, reliable, caring | Paired serif+sans (DM family) | Clean, functional neutrals | Standard radius |

### How Personality Translates to Code

- "Authoritative" → serif display font + `border-radius: 0 !important` globally + navy/gold tokens
- "Warm/Inclusive" → variable font with `SOFT` axis + plum-tinted shadows + generous border-radius
- "Modern/Bold" → geometric sans + tight letter-spacing + grain texture overlay
- "Luxury/Editorial" → high-contrast serif + italic accent font + gold/warm-neutral tokens

→ See **elite-design-core** for token implementation, **elite-gsap** for motion language.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Starting with colors** — Start with personality and audience. Colors follow.
2. **Too many fonts** — Two families maximum. Three font roles (display, body, mono) is the ceiling.
3. **Inconsistent application** — A brand system only works if every touchpoint follows it. Document everything.
4. **Copying competitors** — Differentiation is the point. Study competitors to avoid their choices.
5. **Ignoring accessibility** — A brand that can't be perceived by all users isn't a complete brand.
6. **Decoration over purpose** — Every brand element should communicate something. If it's just decoration, remove it.
7. **Skipping verbal identity** — Tone of voice is as important as visual identity. A beautiful site with generic copy feels hollow.

## Generating the Brand Package

After completing brand discovery (Phases 1-5), generate a complete `brand-assets/` folder with all deliverables:

→ See [brand-package.md](references/brand-package.md)

This produces:
- Design tokens (Tailwind v4 @theme + semantic layer)
- Logo placeholders (icon, wordmark, combination SVGs)
- Favicon set (SVG favicon + Apple touch icon)
- Social templates (OG image + profile image)
- Starter CSS (base styles + component library)
- Brand guidelines document

All branded with the user's discovery answers — not generic templates.
